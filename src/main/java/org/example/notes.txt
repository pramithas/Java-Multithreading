How many threads are needed are determined by these factors:

1. How many CPUs the computer has.
2. What type of work the thread perform.
3. Desired fairness between threads.



2. If a task is CPU intensive, there is no much advantage running two threads in a CPU. But, if the task
is something affecting UI, then it makes to run those using two threads so that a single user does not
have to wait too long (thread fairness).

But, generally, we have one threads per CPU for CPU intensive tasks.

But, if the CPU performs mostly IO operations, it means that it has to waiting operation quite a bit.
So, in that time another threads can perform some other tasks. Basically, two threads can perform CPU
and IO intensive tasks alternatively.

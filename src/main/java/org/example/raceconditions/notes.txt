Race conditions is a situation where

    - Two or more threads access the same variable(s) (or data) in a way where the final result stored
      in a variable depends on how threads access to the variables is scheduled.

Race Conditions occur when

    - Two or more threads read and write the same variable(s) or data concurrently.

    - The threads access the variable(s) using either of these patterns:
        - Check then act.
        - Read modify write.
            - where the modified value depends on the previously read value.
    - The thread access to the variable(s) or data is not atomic.
